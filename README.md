## Anticapture Framework
The [[Anticapture Framework]] defines and explores [[capture-resistant governance]] from first principles, building off of the concepts of [[networks]], [[agents]], [[resources]], and [[actions]].

### Principles
The Anticapture Framework strives to be...
- Derived from first principles
- Non-prescriptive
- Modular
- Open to permissionless contribution

### Objectives
The Anticapture Framework seeks to...

1. Create a foundation on which to build knowledge and practices relating to [[capture-resistant governance]], decentralized communities, web3, [[DAOs]], power dynamics, and related topics.
2. Create a shared language describing, discussing, and debating the concepts listed in (1).
3. Foster a community of Anticapture-related research and practice that models strong capture-resistance.
4. Interoperate with other projects relating to topics listed in (1).

## Reading
To facilitate non-linear consumption as well as modular, permissionless development of the framework, Anticapture is presented as a wiki. 

Each page covers a distinct, atomic concept, and includes links to pages covering related components of the framework. These links are constructed as backlinks in order to support knowledge graphs as well as wikis. Since it uses the `[[double brackets]]`  convention, open source knowledge graph tools such as Obsidian and Logseq are recommended ways to explore the framework.

## Contributing
Currently, there is no canonical version of the Anticapture Framework. At some point in the future, a DAO may be formed to establish, curate, and promote a canonical version of the framework. Until then, contributors to and users of the framework should work off of the version they prefer. Forking and modification is highly encouraged.

The only requirements are: 
1. All pages are markdown documents. Assets (such as images, code workbooks, and other file formats) must be embedded in markdown documents.
2. Links to internal pages use the `[[double brackets]]` standard supported by knowledge graph tools such as Obsidian and Logseq.

### Repositories
There is currently no canonical or official repository for the Anticapture Framework. 

The Anticapture Framework's native home is on the Radicle network, due to its decentralized nature and highly-aligned model of projects and patches.

However, for ease of access, an early contributor to the Anticapture Framework maintains a repository on Github that mirrors their project on Radicle.
